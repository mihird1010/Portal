<p>Gameplay<br />
The game consists of two parts. Solving questions to earn points and making the longest path from pipes available in your inventory. The total score of a team will be the cumulative of the points earned by solving questions and submission of a valid path. </p>

<p>Solving Questions<br />
Each question has two attempts. There are easy, medium and difficult questions available for the users to solve. The marking scheme for the questions is as follows.</p>

<p>
Easy - 50 points<br />
Medium - 100 points<br />
Difficult - 150 points</p>

<p>There will be NO NEGATIVE MARKING for wrong answers on both the attempts.</p>

<p>Arena and Inventory<br />
The arena <br />
The cost of each pipe is 100 points which will be deducted from the user&rsquo;s total score. Your inventory with the number of pipes of each type will be displayed on the right side of the screen.</p>

<p>Making a Path and scoring<br />
The team will benefit by making the longest possible path from the available inventory. Each pipe on the board used in making the path gives the user 200 points. Pipe pieces on the board, which do not contribute to the path will not give any points. If the total pathlength equals or exceeds 18 pipes correctly used, the team will get a 1000 point bonus and for 12 pipes or more but less than 18, the team will get a 500 point bonus. </p>

<p>Pulling the Submit plug<br />
The teams can submit their path only once. They will not be allowed to login thereafter. Also, if a team fails to submit their final score before the deadline, it will not be added in their final score.<br />
